### What is Git and why is it important?

**Git** is a distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. It allows multiple people to work on a project simultaneously without interfering with each otherâ€™s work. Git keeps track of changes made to files, so you can recall specific versions later.

**Importance of Git:**
1. **Collaboration:** Multiple developers can work on the same project simultaneously without overwriting each other's changes.
2. **Version Control:** Tracks changes to the codebase, allowing you to revert to previous states if needed.
3. **Branching and Merging:** Facilitates the creation of branches for new features or bug fixes, which can be merged back into the main codebase.
4. **Backup:** Provides a backup of the project, as every developer has a complete copy of the repository.
5. **History:** Maintains a detailed history of changes, who made them, and when, aiding in debugging and understanding the evolution of a project.

### What is the difference between Main Branch and Master Branch?

The **Main Branch** and **Master Branch** essentially serve the same purpose in Git, which is to be the primary branch where the codebase's stable version resides. However, the difference lies in naming conventions:

- **Master Branch:** Traditionally, the default branch created in Git repositories was named "master". This has been the standard for many years.
- **Main Branch:** Recently, there has been a shift towards using "main" as the default branch name, mainly for inclusivity and to avoid any potentially negative connotations associated with the term "master".

### Can you explain the difference between Git and GitHub?

**Git**:
- A distributed version control system.
- Manages and tracks changes in source code.
- Can be used locally on a machine without requiring any online service.

**GitHub**:
- A web-based platform that uses Git for version control.
- Provides a central repository for code sharing and collaboration.
- Offers additional features such as issue tracking, project management, and social coding (pull requests, forks, etc.).
- Integrates with CI/CD pipelines and other tools to enhance the development workflow.

### How do you create a new repository on GitHub?

To create a new repository on GitHub:
1. **Sign in to GitHub**: Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and log in to your account.
2. **New Repository**: Click the "New" button or the "+" icon in the upper right corner and select "New repository".
3. **Repository Details**: Enter the repository name, an optional description, and choose between a public or private repository.
4. **Initialize Repository**: Optionally, add a README file, .gitignore template, or a license.
5. **Create Repository**: Click the "Create repository" button.

### What is the difference between a local & remote repository? How to connect local to remote?

**Local Repository**:
- A version-controlled directory on your local machine.
- Contains your working files, staging area, and a history of commits.

**Remote Repository**:
- A version-controlled repository hosted on a server (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket).
- Used for collaboration and backup.
- Accessible over a network.

**Connecting Local to Remote**:
1. **Create Local Repository**: Initialize a local repository using `git init`.
2. **Create Remote Repository**: On GitHub or another hosting service, create a new repository.
3. **Link Local to Remote**: Add the remote repository URL to your local repository using:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin <remote_repository_URL>
   ```
4. **Push Changes**: Push your local commits to the remote repository using:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin main
   ```
   Replace "main" with the name of your default branch if different.

By connecting a local repository to a remote one, you can synchronize changes between your local machine and the remote server, facilitating collaboration and backup.
